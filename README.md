## Project proposal

### Idea

Implement, test and benchmark a doubly linked list in Rust. As mentioned by our
tutors, implementing this data structure isn't trivial, so we want to prove to
ourselves, that we can do it!

We hope to learn how to implement this data structure in Rust and thanks to
that we will have a better understanding of Rust. Also we hope to learn how to
properly test and benchmark code in Rust.

### Requirements

- Implement doubly linked list
- Test the implementation
- Benchmark the doubly linked list in various scenarious

### Notice

We are open to any recommendation, critique and feedback. We want to communicate
with our tutors on weekly basis. We will show them our progress and discuss
any shortcommings, details, and possible extensions of our project.
