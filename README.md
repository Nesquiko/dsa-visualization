# DSA Visualization

Project for Rust Course on FIIT STU.

## Authors

- Lukas Castven (Discord: Nesquiko#1631, Rust-101 Discord: Lukas)

## Project proposal

### Idea

GUI for visualizing different data structures and algorithms. We hope to learn
how to implement different data structures and algorithms in Rust, and also
how to build GUI applications in Rust, either in web browser through WASM,
or native ones.

### Requirements

- Correct implementation of data structures:
  - Linked List
  - Hash Table
  - Graph
- Correct implementation of algorithms:
  - Depth-First-Search
  - Dijkstra's algorithm
- Visualize data structures and algorithms with a GUI

### Possibly used Crates

For the DSA part of our project, no crates are needed, however for the GUI part
there are many crates that at first glance look like what we need, but we want
to consult the right one with our tutors.

#### Candidates for the GUI:

- [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/)
- [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)
- [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos)
- [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui)
- [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)
